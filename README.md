Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a key fat metabolism protein. APOE is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, orthologs of APOE protein was extracted from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, data source from 153 genes was translated from DNA nucleotide sequence with Python3 script into amino acid sequence. Translated amino acid sequence was aligned through C++ based program Clustal Omega. Multiple sequence alignment(MSA) results was analyzed to identify key motif in APOE translation.
